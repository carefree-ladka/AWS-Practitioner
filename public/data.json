      "feedbacks": ["", "", "", ""],
      "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>EC2 Reserved Instance (RI)</strong></p>\n\n<p>An EC2 Reserved Instance (RI) provides you with significant savings (up to 75%) on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. A Reserved Instance (RI) is not a physical instance, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. You can purchase a Reserved Instance (RI) for a one-year or three-year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. A reserved instance (RI) cannot be interrupted. So this is the correct option.</p>\n\n<p>EC2 Pricing Options Overview:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt1-q8-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/</a></p>\n\n<p>Options incorrectes:</p>\n\n<p><strong>EC2 On-Demand Instance</strong> - An EC2 On-Demand Instance is an instance that you use on-demand. You have full control over its lifecycle — you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. The price per second for running an On-Demand Instance is fixed. On-demand instances cannot be interrupted. However, On-demand instances are not as cost-effective as Reserved instances, so this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EC2 Spot Instance</strong> - An EC2 Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts (up to 90%), you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and optional tasks. These can be terminated at short notice, so these are not suitable for critical workloads that need to run at a specific point in time.

In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete.

With AWS Budgets, you can choose to be alerted by email or SNS notification when actual or forecasted cost and usage exceed your budget threshold, or when your actual RI and Savings Plans' utilization or coverage drops below your desired threshold. With AWS Budget Actions, you can also configure specific actions to respond to cost and usage status in your accounts, so that if your cost or usage exceeds or is forecasted to exceed your threshold, actions can be executed automatically or with your approval to reduce unintentional over-spending.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Cost Explorer</strong> - AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. Cost Explorer Resource Rightsizing Recommendations and Compute Optimizer use the same recommendation engine. The Compute Optimizer recommendation engine delivers recommendations to help customers identify optimal EC2 instance types for their workloads. The Cost Explorer console and API surface a subset of these recommendations that may lead to cost savings, and augments them with customer-specific cost and savings information (e.g. billing information, available credits, RI, and Savings Plans) to help Cost Management owners quickly identify savings opportunities through infrastructure rightsizing.

      "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enable client-side encryption using AWS encryption SDK</strong></p>\n\n<p>The act of encrypting data before sending it to Amazon S3 is termed as client-side encryption. The AWS encryption SDK is a client-side encryption library that is separate from the language–specific SDKs. You can use this encryption library to more easily implement encryption best practices in Amazon S3. Unlike the Amazon S3 encryption clients in the language–specific AWS SDKs, the AWS encryption SDK is not tied to Amazon S3 and can be used to encrypt or decrypt data to be stored anywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enable server-side encryption with Amazon S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3)</strong> - When you use server-side encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3), each object is encrypted with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a root key that it regularly rotates.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enable server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS)</strong> - Server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) is similar to SSE-S3, but with some additional benefits and charges for using this service. There are separate permissions for the use of a KMS key that provides added protection against unauthorized access of your objects in Amazon S3. SSE-KMS also provides you with an audit trail that shows when your KMS key was used and by whom.</p>\n\n<p>Server-side encryption is the encryption of data at its destination by the application or service that receives it. Amazon S3 encrypts your data at the object level as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. Hence, server-side encryption is not the right answer for the current scenario. So both these options are incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Encryption is enabled by default for all the objects written to Amazon S3. Additional configuration is not required</strong> - Although it's correct that encryption is enabled by default for all the objects written to Amazon S3, however, the given use case mandates that data be encrypted before sending it to Amazon S3, which cannot be accomplished with the given option. So this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingClientSideEncryption.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingClientSideEncryption.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html</a></p>\n",

It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS gives the highest level of flexibility and management control over IT resources. Examples - Amazon EC2 (on AWS), GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode.</p>\n\n<p>PaaS removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. You don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application. Examples - Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS), Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft).</p>\n\n<p>SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed.

Quotas, also referred to as limits in AWS, are the maximum values for the resources, actions, and items in your AWS account. Each AWS service defines its quotas and establishes default values for those quotas.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS CloudTrail</strong> - AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure.

You can choose to receive alerts by email when charges have exceeded a certain threshold. Think resource performance monitoring, events, and alerts; think CloudWatch. Amazon CloudWatch cannot be used to identify under-utilized Amazon EC2 instances without manually configuring an alarm with the appropriate threshold to track the Amazon EC2 utilization, so this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Budgets</strong> - AWS Budgets gives the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount. You can also use AWS Budgets to set reservation utilization or coverage targets and receive alerts when your utilization drops below the threshold you define. AWS Budgets can be created at the monthly, quarterly, or yearly level, and you can customize the start and end dates. You can further refine your budget to track costs associated with multiple dimensions, such as AWS service, linked account, tag, and others.

If you have large quantities of data you need to migrate into AWS, offline data transfer with AWS Snowball can overcome the challenge of limited bandwidth, and avoid the need to lease additional bandwidth. AWS Snowball moves terabytes of data in about a week.

By default, instances that you launch into an Amazon VPC can't communicate with your own (remote) network. You can enable access to your remote network from your VPC by creating an AWS Site-to-Site VPN (Site-to-Site VPN) connection, and configuring routing to pass traffic through the connection. VPN aids regular connectivity of AWS and your private om-premises network, it is not a data migration solution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Direct Connect</strong> - AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. You can use AWS Direct Connect to establish a private virtual interface from your on-premise network directly to your Amazon VPC, providing you with a private, high bandwidth network connection between your network and your VPC. This connection is private and does not go over the public internet. It takes at least a month to establish this physical connection. It is not feasible to set up AWS Direct Connect in remote locations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Transit Gateway</strong> - AWS Transit Gateway connects VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub. This simplifies your network and puts an end to complex peering relationships. It acts as a cloud router – each new connection is only made once.

Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Agility</strong> - Agility refers to the ability of the cloud to give you easy access to a broad range of technologies so that you can innovate faster and build nearly anything that you can imagine. You can quickly spin up resources as you need them – from infrastructure services, such as compute, storage, and databases, to Internet of Things, machine learning, data lakes and analytics, and much more.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Elasticity</strong> - With cloud computing elasticity, you don’t have to over-provision resources upfront to handle peak levels of business activity in the future. Instead, you provision the number of resources that you actually need. You can scale these resources up or down instantly to grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cost savings</strong> - The cloud allows you to trade capital expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable expenses, and only pay for IT as you consume it. Plus, the variable expenses are much lower than what you would pay to do it yourself because of the economies of scale.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability to deploy globally in minutes</strong> - With the cloud, you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes.

Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts (up to 90%), you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and other flexible tasks that can be interrupted.

You have full control over its lifecycle — you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. The price per second for running an On-Demand Instance is fixed. On-demand instances cannot be interrupted. However, On-demand instances are not as cost-effective as spot instances, so this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reserved Instance (RI)</strong> - Reserved Instances (RI) provide you with significant savings (up to 75%) on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. Reserved Instances (RI) are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. You can purchase a Reserved Instance (RI) for a one-year or three-year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. Reserved instances (RI) cannot be interrupted. Reserved instances (RI) are not as cost-effective as spot instances, so this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dedicated Host</strong> - Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2 so that you get the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of using your licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity, and elasticity of AWS.

Read replicas allow you to create read-only copies that are synchronized with your master database. Read replicas are used for improved read performance. You can also place your read replica in a different AWS Region closer to your users for better performance. Using a cross-Region read replica can also help ensure that you get back up and running if you experience a regional availability issue in case of a disaster.

When you provision an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention. Think of multi-AZ deployment as enhancing the availability and reliability of your system, however, by itself, multi-AZ deployment cannot be used for disaster recovery.</p>\n\n<p>How multi-AZ deployment works:\n<img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/asset-repository/multi-az-deployments.bda9d7bf45a74103d0331a985baf2c5fb838a0fa.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/</a></p>\n\n<p>To understand the Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) disaster recovery capabilities in more detail, you can refer to this excellent AWS blog:\n<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/implementing-a-disaster-recovery-strategy-with-amazon-rds/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/implementing-a-disaster-recovery-strategy-with-amazon-rds/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>You can use read replicas for improved read performance and Multi-AZ deployment for disaster recovery</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>You can use both read replicas and Multi-AZ deployment for improved read performance</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>You can use read replicas for disaster recovery and Multi-AZ deployment for improved read performance</strong></p>\n\n<p>These three options contradict the details provided earlier in the explanation, so these options are incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/implementing-a-disaster-recovery-strategy-with-amazon-rds/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/implementing-a-disaster-recovery-strategy-with-amazon-rds/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/</a></p>\n",

      "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>On-Demand Instance</strong></p>\n\n<p>An On-Demand Instance is an instance that you use on-demand. You have full control over its lifecycle — you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. There is no need for a long-term purchasing commitment. The price per second for running an On-Demand Instance is fixed. On-demand instances cannot be interrupted. Therefore On-Demand instances are the best fit for short-term, spiky and critical workloads.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon EC2 Pricing Options Overview:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt4-q15-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spot Instance</strong> - A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts (up to 90%), you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and other flexible tasks that can be interrupted. These can be terminated at short notice, so these are not suitable for critical workloads that need to run at a specific point in time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reserved Instance (RI)</strong> - Reserved Instances (RI) provide you with significant savings (up to 75%) on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. Reserved Instances (RI) are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. You can purchase a Reserved Instance (RI) for a one-year or three-year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. Reserved instances (RI) cannot be interrupted. Reserved instances (RI) are not the right choice for short-term workloads.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dedicated Host</strong> - Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2 so that you get the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of using your licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity, and elasticity of AWS. An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server fully dedicated for your use, so you can help address corporate compliance requirement. They're not cost-efficient compared to On-Demand instances.

You can also use AWS Budgets to set reservation utilization or coverage targets and receive alerts when your utilization drops below the threshold you define. Budgets can be created at the monthly, quarterly, or yearly level, and you can customize the start and end dates. You can further refine your budget to track costs associated with multiple dimensions, such as AWS service, linked account, tag, and others.

You can model your solutions before building them, explore the price points and calculations behind your estimate, and find the available instance types and contract terms that meet your needs. This enables you to make informed decisions about using AWS. You can plan your AWS costs and usage or price out setting up a new set of instances and services.

If the passive stack is deployed to the recovery Region at full capacity, however, then this strategy is known as “hot standby.” Because warm standby deploys a functional stack to the recovery Region, this makes it easier to test Region readiness using synthetic transactions.</p>\n\n<p>Disaster recovery (DR) strategies:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt4-q56-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Multi-site active-active strategy</strong> - This strategy uses AWS Regions as your active sites, creating a multi-Region active/active architecture. Generally, two Regions are used. Each Region hosts a highly available, multi-Availability Zone (AZ) workload stack. In each Region, data is replicated live between the data stores and also backed up. This protects against disasters that include data deletion or corruption since the data backup can be restored to the last known good state. Each regional stack serves production traffic effectively. But, this strategy is cost involving and should only be used for mission-critical applications.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pilot Light strategy</strong> - Pilot Light, like  Warm Standby strategy, replicates data from the primary Region to data resources in the recovery Region, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) DB instances or Amazon DynamoDB tables. But, the DR Region in a pilot light strategy (unlike warm standby) cannot serve requests until additional steps are taken. A pilot light in a home furnace does not provide heat to the home. It provides a quick way to light the furnace burners that then provide heat.</p>\n\n<p>Warm standby can handle traffic at reduced levels immediately. Pilot light requires you to first deploy infrastructure and then scale out resources before the workload can handle requests.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Backup &amp; Restore strategy</strong> - Backup and Restore is associated with higher RTO (recovery time objective) and RPO (recovery point objective). This results in longer downtimes and greater loss of data between when the disaster event occurs and recovery. However, backup and restore can still be the right strategy for workloads because it is the easiest and least expensive strategy to implement.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/</a></p>\n",

By default, new buckets, access points, and objects don't allow public access. However, users can modify bucket policies, access point policies, or object permissions to allow public access. S3 Block Public Access settings override these policies and permissions so that you can limit public access to these resources.</p>\n\n<p>When Amazon S3 receives a request to access a bucket or an object, it determines whether the bucket or the bucket owner's account has a block public access setting applied. If the request was made through an access point, Amazon S3 also checks for block public access settings for the access point.

Unlike other S3 Storage Classes which store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones (AZs), S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single Availability Zone (AZ) and costs 20% less than S3 Standard-IA. S3 One Zone-IA is ideal for customers who want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data but do not require the availability and resilience of S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA. It’s a good choice for storing secondary backup copies of on-premises data or easily re-creatable data. You can also use it as cost-effective storage for data that is replicated from another AWS Region using S3 cross-region replication (S3 CRR).</p>\n\n<p>Exam Alert:</p>\n\n<p>Please review this detailed comparison of S3 Storage Classes as you can expect a few questions on this aspect of S3:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt5-q17-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/\">https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive</strong> - Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class is designed to provide durable and secure long-term storage for large amounts of data at a price that is competitive with off-premises tape archival services. Data is stored across 3 or more AWS Availability Zones(AZs) and can be retrieved in 12 hours or less. You no longer need to deal with expensive and finicky tape drives, arrange for off-premises storage, or worry about migrating data to newer generations of media.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon S3 Standard</strong> - Amazon S3 Standard offers high durability, availability, and performance object storage for frequently accessed data. Because it delivers low latency and high throughput, Amazon S3 Standard is appropriate for a wide variety of use cases, including cloud applications, dynamic websites, content distribution, mobile and gaming applications, and big data analytics.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)</strong> - Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) is for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed. S3 Standard-IA offers the high durability, high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard, with a low per GB storage price and per GB retrieval fee. This combination of low cost and high performance makes S3 Standard-IA ideal for long-term storage, backups, and as a data store for disaster recovery files. It can be used for backups, but it is more expensive than S3 One Zone - Infrequent Access. Hence, S3 One Zone - Infrequent Access is a better option for secondary backup copies.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/\">https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/</a></p>\n",

This allows for automatic notification and tracking of failures, and for automated recovery processes that work around or repair the failure. With more sophisticated automation, it's possible to anticipate and remediate failures before they occur.

For example, storage services can act as static websites, removing the need for web servers, and event services can host your code for you. This not only removes the operational burden of managing these servers but also can lower transactional costs because these managed services operate at a cloud scale.

For extra security, AWS recommends that you use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the root user in your account. With MFA, users have a device that generates a response to an authentication challenge. Both the user's credentials and the device-generated response are required to complete the sign-in process.

You should change your own passwords and access keys regularly, and make sure that all IAM users in your account do as well. That way, if a password or access key is compromised without your knowledge, you limit how long the credentials can be used to access your resources.

Amazon QLDB can be used to track each and every application data change and maintains a complete and verifiable history of changes over time.</p>\n\n<p>Ledgers are typically used to record a history of economic and financial activity in an organization. Many organizations build applications with ledger-like functionality because they want to maintain an accurate history of their applications' data, for example, tracking the history of credits and debits in banking transactions, verifying the data lineage of an insurance claim, or tracing the movement of an item in a supply chain network. Ledger applications are often implemented using custom audit tables or audit trails created in relational databases.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon QLDB is a new class of databases that eliminates the need to engage in the complex development effort of building your own ledger-like applications. With QLDB, your data’s change history is immutable – it cannot be altered or deleted – and using cryptography, you can easily verify that there have been no unintended modifications to your application’s data. QLDB uses an immutable transactional log, known as a journal, that tracks each application data change and maintains a complete and verifiable history of changes over time. QLDB is easy to use because it provides developers with a familiar SQL-like API, a flexible document data model, and full support for transactions. QLDB’s streaming capability provides a near real-time flow of your data stored within QLDB, allowing you to develop event-driven workflows, and real-time analytics, and to replicate data to other AWS services to support advanced analytical processing. QLDB is also serverless, so it automatically scales to support the demands of your application. There are no servers to manage and no read or write limits to configure. With QLDB, you only pay for what you use.</p>\n\n<p>How Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (Amazon QLDB) Works:\n<img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/r2018/h/99Product-Page-Diagram_AWS-Quantum.f03953678ba33a2d1b12aee6ee530e45507e7ac9.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/qldb/\">https://aws.amazon.com/qldb/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Neptune</strong> - Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully-managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets.

Amazon Timestream saves you time and costs in managing the lifecycle of time series data by keeping recent data in memory and moving historical data to a cost-optimized storage tier based upon user-defined policies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Managed Blockchain</strong> - Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service that allows you to join public networks or set up and manage scalable private networks using popular open-source frameworks. Amazon Managed Blockchain eliminates the overhead required to create the network or join a public network and automatically scales to meet the demands of thousands of applications running millions of transactions.</p>\n\n<p>While QLDB is a ledger database purpose-built for customers who need to maintain a complete and verifiable history of data changes in an application that they own and manage in a centralized way, QLDB is not a blockchain technology. Instead, blockchain technologies focus on enabling multiple parties to transact and share data securely in a decentralized way; without a trusted, central authority. Every member in a network has an independently verifiable copy of an immutable ledger, and members can create and endorse transactions in the network.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/qldb/\">https://aws.amazon.com/qldb/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/\">https://aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/</a></p>\n",

Inbound rules control the incoming traffic to your instance, and outbound rules control the outgoing traffic from your instance. When you launch an instance, you can specify one or more security groups. If you don't specify a security group, Amazon EC2 uses the default security group. You can add rules to each security group that allows traffic to or from its associated instances. You can modify the rules for a security group at any time.

When Amazon EC2 decides whether to allow traffic to reach an instance, it evaluates all of the rules from all of the security groups that are associated with the instance.</p>\n\n<p>Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and you. AWS provides security groups as one of the tools for securing your instances, and you need to configure them to meet your security needs.

The Backup and restore strategy offers a good balance of benefits and cost for the current use case. This is the cheapest of all the disaster recovery options available with AWS.</p>\n\n<p>Backup and restore is the most suitable approach for the given use case as the university can tolerate data loss of a few hours. This approach can be used to mitigate against a regional disaster by replicating data to other AWS Regions or to mitigate the lack of redundancy for workloads deployed to a single Availability Zone. In addition to data, you must redeploy the infrastructure, configuration, and application code in the recovery Region.</p>\n\n<p>Comparing different disaster recovery strategies:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt6-q29-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pilot light strategy</strong> - With the pilot light approach, you replicate your data from one Region to another and provision a copy of your core workload infrastructure. Resources required to support data replication and backup, such as databases and object storage, are always on. Other elements, such as application servers, are loaded with application code and configurations but are switched off and are only used during testing or when disaster recovery failover is invoked. Unlike the backup and restore approach, your core infrastructure is always available and you always have the option to quickly provision a full-scale production environment by switching on and scaling out your application servers. This also implies that the cost incurred is higher than what it is for the backup and restore approach.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Multi-site active/active strategy</strong> - You can run your workload simultaneously in multiple AWS Regions as part of a multi-site active/active strategy. Multi-site active/active serves traffic from all regions to which it is deployed. With a multi-site active/active approach, users can access the workload in any of the Regions in which it is deployed. This approach is the most complex and costliest for disaster recovery.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Warm standby strategy</strong> - The warm standby approach involves ensuring that there is a scaled-down but fully functional copy of your production environment in another AWS Region. This approach extends the pilot light concept and decreases the time to recovery because your workload is always-on in another Region. This approach also allows you to more easily perform testing or implement continuous testing to increase confidence in your ability to recover from a disaster. This strategy is costly and is used only for business-critical applications.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws/disaster-recovery-options-in-the-cloud.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws/disaster-recovery-options-in-the-cloud.html</a></p>\n",

It is designed for customers — particularly those in highly-regulated industries, such as the Financial Services, Healthcare, and Public Sectors — that retain data sets for 7-10 years or longer to meet regulatory compliance requirements. S3 Glacier Deep Archive can also be used for backup and disaster recovery use cases, and is a cost-effective and easy-to-manage alternative to magnetic tape systems, whether they are on-premises libraries or off-premises services.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive complements Amazon S3 Glacier, which is ideal for archives where data is regularly retrieved and some of the data may be needed in minutes. All objects stored in S3 Glacier Deep Archive are replicated and stored across at least three geographically-dispersed Availability Zones, protected by 99.999999999% of durability, and can be restored within 12 hours.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval</strong> - Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval delivers low-cost storage, up to 10% lower cost (than Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval), for archive data that is accessed 1—2 times per year and is retrieved asynchronously. For archive data that does not require immediate access but needs the flexibility to retrieve large sets of data at no cost, such as backup or disaster recovery use cases, Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly Amazon S3 Glacier) is the ideal storage class.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)</strong> - Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. S3 Standard-IA offers the high durability, high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard, with a low per GB storage price and per GB retrieval fee. This combination of low cost and high performance makes S3 Standard-IA ideal for long-term storage, backups, and as a data store for disaster recovery files. S3 Storage Classes can be configured at the object level and a single bucket can contain objects stored across S3 Standard, S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA, and S3 One Zone-IA. You can also use S3 Lifecycle policies to automatically transition objects between storage classes without any application changes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering</strong> - Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering (S3 Intelligent-Tiering) is the only cloud storage class that delivers automatic cost savings by moving objects between four access tiers when access patterns change. The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without operational overhead. It works by storing objects in four access tiers: two low latency access tiers optimized for frequent and infrequent access, and two optional archive access tiers designed for asynchronous access that are optimized for rare access.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/\">https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/</a></p>\n",

This pricing model offers lower prices on Amazon EC2 instances usage, regardless of instance family, size, OS, tenancy or AWS Region, and also applies to AWS Fargate and AWS Lambda usage.</p>\n\n<p>Savings Plans offer significant savings over On-Demand, just like EC2 Reserved Instances, in exchange for a commitment to use a specific amount of compute power (measured in $/hour) for a one or three-year period. You can sign up for Savings Plans for a 1- or 3-year term and easily manage your plans by taking advantage of recommendations, performance reporting and budget alerts in the AWS Cost Explorer.</p>\n\n<p>AWS offers two types of Savings Plans:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Compute Savings Plans provide the most flexibility and help to reduce your costs by up to 66%. These plans automatically apply to EC2 instance usage regardless of instance family, size, AZ, region, OS or tenancy, and also apply to Fargate and Lambda usage. For example, with Compute Savings Plans, you can change from C4 to M5 instances, shift a workload from EU (Ireland) to EU (London), or move a workload from EC2 to Fargate or Lambda at any time and automatically continue to pay the Savings Plans price.</p></li>\n<li><p>EC2 Instance Savings Plans provide the lowest prices, offering savings up to 72% in exchange for a commitment to the usage of individual instance families in a region (e.g. M5 usage in N. Virginia). This automatically reduces your cost on the selected instance family in that region regardless of AZ, size, OS or tenancy. EC2 Instance Savings Plans give you the flexibility to change your usage between instances within a family in that region.

SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message-oriented middleware and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work. Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available. Get started with SQS in minutes using the AWS console, Command Line Interface or SDK of your choice, and three simple commands.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon SQS uses a pull mechanism, i.e. the messages in the queue are available till a registered process pulls the messages to process them. This decouples the architecture since the second application does not need to be available all the time to process messages coming from application one.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)</strong> - Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fully managed messaging service for both application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication. The A2A pub/sub functionality provides topics for high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging between distributed systems, microservices, and event-driven serverless applications. Amazon SNS allows applications to send time-critical messages to multiple subscribers through a “push” mechanism, which implies that the receiving applications have to be present and running to receive the messages. There is a scope for message loss in SNS and hence SQS is the right choice for this use case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Kinesis data stream</strong> - Amazon Kinesis Data Streams enables you to build custom applications that process or analyze streaming data for specialized needs. You can continuously add various types of data such as clickstreams, application logs, and social media to an Amazon Kinesis data stream from hundreds of thousands of sources. Within seconds, the data will be available for your Amazon Kinesis Applications to read and process from the stream. Kinesis Data streams are overkill for this use-case since Kinesis Data Streams are meant for real-time processing of streaming big data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Lambda</strong> - AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code as a ZIP file or container image, and Lambda automatically and precisely allocates compute execution power and runs your code based on the incoming request or event, for any scale of traffic. Lambda functions cannot self invocate and need to be called. Also, Lambda functions cannot store data for later processing.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/</a></p>\n",

You can specify controls such as “write once read many” (WORM) in a vault lock policy and lock the policy from future edits. Once locked, the policy can no longer be changed.</p>\n\n<p>A vault lock policy can be locked to prevent future changes, providing strong enforcement for your compliance controls. You can use the vault lock policy to deploy regulatory and compliance controls, which typically require tight controls on data access.</p>\n\n<p>As an example of a Vault Lock policy, suppose that you are required to retain archives for one year before you can delete them. To implement this requirement, you can create a Vault Lock policy that denies users permission to delete an archive until the archive has existed for one year. You can test this policy before locking it down. After you lock the policy, the policy becomes immutable.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon S3 Object Lock</strong> - You can use S3 Object Lock to store objects using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model.

You can use S3 Object Lock to meet regulatory requirements that require WORM storage, or add an extra layer of protection against object changes and deletion.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon S3 Glacier Vault Lock is the right choice here, because with S3 Object Lock, users with special permissions can make changes to the Lock policy and delete the data.

CloudEndure Disaster Recovery enables you to use AWS Cloud as a disaster recovery Region for an on-premises workload and its environment. It can also be used for disaster recovery of AWS hosted workloads if they consist only of applications and databases hosted on EC2 (i.e. not RDS).</p>\n\n<p>Features of CloudEndure Disaster Recovery:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Continuous replication: CloudEndure Disaster Recovery provides continuous, asynchronous, block-level replication of your source machines into a staging area. This allows you to achieve sub-second Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs), since up-to-date applications are always ready to be spun up on AWS if a disaster strikes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Low-cost staging area: Data is continually kept in sync in a lightweight staging area in your target AWS Region. The staging area contains low-cost resources that are automatically provisioned and managed by CloudEndure Disaster Recovery. This eliminates the need for duplicate resources and significantly reduces your disaster recovery total cost of ownership (TCO).</p></li>\n<li><p>Automated machine conversion and orchestration: In the event of a disaster or drill, CloudEndure Disaster Recovery triggers a highly automated machine conversion process and a scalable orchestration engine that quickly spins up thousands of machines in your target AWS Region in parallel. This enables Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) of minutes. Unlike application-level solutions, CloudEndure Disaster Recovery replicates entire machines, including OS, system state configuration, system disks, databases, applications, and files.</p></li>\n<li><p>Point-in-time recovery: Granular point-in-time recovery allows you to recover applications and IT environments that have been corrupted as a result of accidental system changes, ransomware, or other malicious attacks. In such cases, you can launch applications from a previous consistent point in time rather than launching applications in their most up-to-date state. During the recovery, you can select either the latest state or an earlier state from a list of points in time.</p></li>\n<li><p>Easy, non-disruptive drills: With CloudEndure Disaster Recovery, you can conduct disaster recovery drills without disrupting your source environment or risking data loss. During drills, CloudEndure Disaster Recovery spins up machines in your target AWS Region in complete isolation to avoid network conflicts and performance impact.</p></li>\n<li><p>Wide application and infrastructure support: Because CloudEndure Disaster Recovery replicates data at the block level, you can use it for all applications and databases that run on supported versions of Windows and Linux OS.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>CloudEndure Disaster Recovery:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt6-q65-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws/disaster-recovery-options-in-the-cloud.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws/disaster-recovery-options-in-the-cloud.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Snowball Edge</strong> - AWS Snowball Edge is a type of Snowball device with on-board storage and compute power for select AWS capabilities. Snowball Edge can do local processing and edge-computing workloads in addition to transferring data between your local environment and the AWS Cloud. AWS Snowball Edge cannot be used to optimize connections through mobile networks. It cannot be used for continuous replication based disaster recovery.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Storage Gateway</strong> - AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that gives you on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage. Storage Gateway provides a standard set of storage protocols such as iSCSI, SMB, and NFS, which allow you to use AWS storage without rewriting your existing applications. You can take point-in-time snapshots of your Volume Gateway volumes in the form of Amazon EBS snapshots. Using this approach, you can easily supply data from your on-premises applications to your applications running on Amazon EC2 if you require additional on-demand compute capacity for data processing or replacement capacity for disaster recovery purposes. However, Storage Gateways cannot be used for continuous replication based disaster recovery.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CloudCover Disaster Recovery</strong> - This is a made-up option and has been added as a distractor.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws/disaster-recovery-options-in-the-cloud.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws/disaster-recovery-options-in-the-cloud.html</a></p>\n",
